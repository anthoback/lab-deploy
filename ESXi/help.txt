Example of sequence of command to build a standard lab:
 >> create
 >> LabName
 >> ubuntu harfangUbuntu
 >> dc createDomain harfangWin
 >> win10 joinDomain cybereasonWin
 >> 
 >> y

NB: roles are listed in the sample.py file. Only one type should be given, the script doesn't check user's input.
Also createDomain should be placed before any joinDomain.
